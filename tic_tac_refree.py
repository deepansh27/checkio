# CheckIO - Home Challenge 5 : Xs and Os Referee
# http://checkio.org

# Tic-Tac-Toe, sometimes also known as Xs and Os, is a game for two players (X and O)
# who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. 
# The player who succeeds in placing three respective marks in a horizontal, vertical, 
# or diagonal rows (NW-SE and NE-SW) wins the game.
# But we will not be playing this game. You will be the referee for this games results. 
# You are given a result of a game and you must determine if the game ends in a win 
# or a draw as well as who will be the winner. 
# Make sure to return "X" if the X-player wins and "O" if the O-player wins. 
# If the game is a draw, return "D".
# A game's result is presented as a list of strings, where "X" and "O" are players' marks and "." is the empty cell.
# Input: A game result as a list of strings (unicode).
# Output: "X", "O" or "D" as a string.
# Precondition:
#   There is either one winner or a draw.
#   len(game_result) == 3
#   all(len(row) == 3 for row in game_result)
